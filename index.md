Natural language processing lets computers analyze and “understand” human language texts, utilizing methods that combine advanced computer science algorithms with linguistic knowledge.

Our research interests include the applied semantic domain with particular focus on performing semantic inferences on top of textual data, as well as infrastructure algorithms in language processing with focus on syntactic parsing. The Textual Entailment paradigm was introduced by our lab.
