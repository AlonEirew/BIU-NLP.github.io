  title: Towards String-to-Tree Neural Machine Translation
  authors: Roee Aharoni and Yoav Goldberg
  venue: ACL
  type: Conference

  id: string-to-tree-nmt
  abstract: We present a simple method to incorporate syntactic information about the target language in a neural machine translation system by translating into linearized, lexicalized constituency trees. Experiments on the WMT16 German-English news translation task shown improved BLEU scores when compared to a syntax-agnostic NMT baseline trained on the same dataset. An analysis of the translations from the syntax-aware system shows that it performs more reordering during translation in comparison to the baseline. A smallscale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware system.

  title: Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature Representations
  authors: Eliyahu Kiperwasser and Yoav Goldberg
  venue: TACL
  type: Journal
  year: 2016
  url: https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1023
  id: simple-and-accurate-dependency-parsing
  abstract: We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.

   title: Easy-First Dependency Parsing with Hierarchical Tree LSTMs
   authors: Eliyahu Kiperwasser and Yoav Goldberg
   venue: TACL
   type: Journal
   year: 2016
   url: http://aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1032
   id: easy-first-dep-parsing-hierarchical-tree-lstm
   abstract: We suggest a compositional vector representation of parse trees that relies on a recursive combination of recurrent-neural network encoders. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we use the representation as the backbone of a greedy, bottom-up dependency parser, achieving very strong accuracies for English and Chinese, without relying on external word embeddings. The parser’s implementation is available for download at the first author’s webpage.
