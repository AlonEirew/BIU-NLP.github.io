  abstract: "We present a simple method to incorporate syntactic information about the target language in a neural machine translation system by translating into linearized, lexicalized constituency trees. Experiments on the WMT16 German-English news translation task shown improved BLEU scores when compared to a syntax-agnostic NMT baseline trained on the same dataset. An analysis of the translations from the syntax-aware system shows that it performs more reordering during translation in comparison to the baseline. A smallscale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware system."

  title: Morphological Inflection Generation with Hard Monotonic Attention
  authors: Roee Aharoni and Yoav Goldberg
  venue: ACL
  type: Conference
  year: 2017
  url: http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1183
  id: morph-hard
  abstract: We present a neural model for morphological inflection generation which employs a hard attention mechanism, inspired by the nearly-monotonic alignment commonly found between the characters in a word and the characters in its inflection. We evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection generation datasets and show that it provides state of the art results in various setups compared to previous neural and nonneural approaches. Finally we present an analysis of the continuous representations learned by both the hard and soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) models for the task, shedding some light on the features such models extract.

  title: Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature Representations
  authors: Eliyahu Kiperwasser and Yoav Goldberg
  venue: TACL
  type: Journal
  year: 2016
  url: https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q16-1023
  id: simple-and-accurate-dependency-parsing
  abstract: We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.

   abstract: We suggest a compositional vector representation of parse trees that relies on a recursive combination of recurrent-neural network encoders. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we use the representation as the backbone of a greedy, bottom-up dependency parser, achieving very strong accuracies for English and Chinese, without relying on external word embeddings. The parser’s implementation is available for download at the first author’s webpage.
